      "content": "<p>A&nbsp;<strong>meteor shower</strong>&nbsp;is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories.</p>\n<p><strong>Most meteors</strong>&nbsp;are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the&nbsp;<strong>Earth&rsquo;s surface</strong>. Very intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which produce at least 1,000 meteors an hour, most notably from the Leonids.</p>",
