      "content": "<p>A&nbsp;<strong>meteor shower</strong>&nbsp;is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories.</p>\n<p><strong>Most meteors</strong>&nbsp;are smaller than a grain of sand, so almost all of them disintegrate and never hit the&nbsp;<strong>Earth&rsquo;s surface</strong>. Very intense or unusual meteor showers are known as meteor outbursts and meteor storms, which produce at least 1,000 meteors an hour, most notably from the Leonids.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img class=\"wp-image-12 loaded\" src=\"http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/breek/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/480016-PGKTGR-852-1024x683.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/breek/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/480016-PGKTGR-852-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/breek/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/480016-PGKTGR-852-300x200.jpg 300w, http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/breek/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/480016-PGKTGR-852-768x512.jpg 768w, http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/breek/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/480016-PGKTGR-852-100x67.jpg 100w, http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/breek/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/480016-PGKTGR-852-675x450.jpg 675w, http://estudiopatagon.com/themes/wordpress/breek/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/480016-PGKTGR-852-1600x1067.jpg 1600w\" alt=\"\" data-lazy=\"true\" />\n<figcaption>Example Caption</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>The&nbsp;</em><strong>Meteor Data Centre</strong><em>&nbsp;lists over 900 suspected meteor showers of which about 100 are well established.

One estimate is a peak rate of over one hundred thousand meteors an hour,[4] but another, done as the storm abated, estimated in excess of two hundred thousand meteors during the 9 hours of storm, over the entire region of North America east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>\n<p>American Denison Olmsted&nbsp;<strong>(1791&ndash;1859)&nbsp;</strong>explained the event most accurately. After spending the last weeks of&nbsp;<strong>1833&nbsp;</strong>collecting information, he presented his findings in January&nbsp;<strong>1834&nbsp;</strong>to the American Journal of Science and Arts, published in January&ndash;April&nbsp;<strong>1834</strong>, and January&nbsp;<strong>1836</strong>.</p>",
